              Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Learn all you can and be open
              about how you’re feeling. Get copies of your tests (blood work,
              urinalysis, ultrasound, x-rays, etc.) and understand what the
              results mean. That way you can fully participate in the decisions

              Some people find that keeping a health diary is useful to record
              their medications, allergies, blood pressure, and other important
              measurements. It can help you keep track of changes and chart how
              you’re feeling on any given day. You may also find that setting
              personal goals is worthwhile. Just be sure to be specific and
              realistic about your goals and share them with your loved ones so
              they can help you work toward them. Track your progress and reward
              yourself for your successes. You can find some log sheets to help
              you do just that and forms to keep track of your contacts,

            <h2 id="type" class="overview-header">Type of exercise</h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Choose continuous activity such as walking, swimming, bicycling
              (indoors or out), skiing, aerobic dancing or any other activities
              in which you need to move large muscle groups continuously.

              Low-level strengthening exercises may also be beneficial as part

                This is the most difficult to talk about without knowing your
                own exercise capacity. Usually, the following ideas are
                helpful:</span
              >

              <li>
                Your breathing should not be so hard that you cannot talk with
                someone exercising with you. (Try to get an exercise partner
                such as a family member or a friend.)
              </li>
              <li>
                You should feel completely normal within one hour after
                exercising. (If not, slow down next time.)
              </li>
              <li>
                You should not feel so much muscle soreness that it keeps you
                from exercising the next session.
              </li>
              <li>The intensity should be a “comfortable push” level.</li>
              <li>
                Start out slowly each session to warm up, then pick up your
                pace, then slow down again when you are about to finish.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="overview-text">
              The most important thing is to start slowly and progress
              gradually, allowing your body to adapt to the increased levels of
              activity.

              a very important part of your treatment plan for chronic kidney

              a lot of factors, including your kidney function, your other
              medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.),
              your medications, your weight, and your overall health.

                Your dietitian will work with you to create a daily eating plan
                that will take all of these factors into consideration and keep
                you feeling as well as possible. Remember that as your kidney
                function changes over time, your diet will need to change as
                well. Blood tests will help your health care team to decide when
                those changes are needed. The right kidney-friendly diet

            </p>
            <h2 id="pro" class="overview-header">Protein</h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Protein builds, repairs and maintains your body tissues. It also
              helps your body to fight infections and heal wounds. As your body
              breaks down the protein in your food, a waste product called urea
              is formed. If urea isn’t removed from your blood, it can put added
              stress on your kidneys and cause tiredness, nausea, headaches and
              a bad taste in your mouth. Most Canadians get more protein than
              they need. You should have 2-3 servings every day, each one about
              the size of a deck of cards, unless your dietitian tells you
              otherwise. There is protein in milk, eggs, legumes, nuts, fish,
              poultry, and lean meat.
            </p>
            <h2 id="sod" class="overview-header">Sodium</h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              As your kidney function gets worse, your body is less able to
              remove extra sodium from your blood. That sodium can increase your
              blood pressure and cause swelling in your ankles and legs. People
              with chronic kidney disease usually need to limit their salt
              intake to less than 2000 mg per day (one teaspoon of salt has 2300
              mg of sodium). The best way to do this is to replace processed
              foods with homemade food, so that you can control the amount of
              salt you’re taking in. Processed foods like deli meats, snack
              foods, fast food, canned vegetables, cheese, pickles, and
              condiments all have salt added to them. Even bread and other baked
              products often contain hidden salt, so be sure to read food
              labels. When you’re cooking at home, try using pepper, onions,
              garlic, lime, lemon, or vinegar to season your food
            </p>
            <h2 id="phos" class="overview-header">Phosphorus (Phosphate)</h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Phosphorus is a mineral that keeps your bones strong and healthy,
              but too much of it can cause itchy skin or painful joints. When
              your kidneys start to fail, the phosphate levels in your blood
              will increase. At that point you may need to limit foods that
              contain phosphorus, especially those that have phosphates added to
              them to lengthen shelf life or enhance flavour. Your dietitian
              will work with you to make sure you’re limiting phosphates and
              still getting the other nutrients you need for good health. Your
              doctor may also prescribe phosphate binders to control your blood
              phosphate levels. These medications bind with phosphorus in your
              intestine so that it passes out of the body in your stool.

            <p class="overview-text">
              Are sexual problems common for people with kidney failure? Sexual
              problems are common for men and women who have kidney disease. Not
              only are emotional problems likely to occur because of the stress
              of kidney disease, but also there are a number of medical
              conditions that can affect sexual function and ability to have
              children, in both men and women.

              Emotional problems that can cause sexual difficulty
            </h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Many people in their lifetime suffer with some sort of emotional
              problems leading to sexual difficulties. The stability of a
              relationship prior to the onset of kidney failure can play a
              significant part in dealing with sexual difficulties of both men
              and women. Some common emotional problems are caused by people
              going through a grieving process due to loss of kidney function,
              independence, their job and place in the family. Change in body
              image, or not feeling a whole man or whole woman due to decreased
              sexual function. Dialysis can lead to lowered self esteem with
              anger and depression, also affecting sexual function.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Partners can feel powerless in a relationship because they do not
              know what to do to help the person with kidney failure, or if they
              receive a negative reaction when trying to help. The equal balance
              of the relationship may have changed, one seeing themselves as the
              carer and the other in a sick role. People need to talk about
              their fears and feelings. They also need to know that what they
              have said has been heard by the other person. Other hidden fears
              may also be present. For instance, some people may believe that
              kidney disease could be transferred during sex. This is not true.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Many kidney patients and their partners may want to have
              counselling, either by a psychologist or sexual counsellor. This
              can be very effective.

            </h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              In the past, many health professionals working with kidney
              patients have tended to avoid getting involved with their
              patients’ sexual problems. Even now, despite the more general
              interest and openness about sexual matters, people with kidney
              disease may still find that they have to raise the subject first.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Another possible reason why some doctors and nurses have avoided
              the subject of sexual problems has been a mistaken belief that the
              available treatments were unlikely to work. This view needs to be
              updated.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              As with other aspects of kidney failure, there isn’t usually just
              one straightforward problem that can be easily corrected. Often
              there are several issues to look at and patience is required.
              Nevertheless, treatment is usually successful, provided both
              partners are keen to have a sex life and are willing to accept
              help. It may be possible to adjust medication, increase dialysis,
              improve haemoglobin or treat erectile problems.

            <h2 id="contra" class="overview-header">Contraception</h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Contraception is important for people with kidney disease, just as
              it is for everyone else. Don’t assume that just because you have
              kidney failure that you cannot have a child. The coil
              contraceptive and condoms are safe for people with kidney disease
              to use. The oral contraceptive pill can cause some complications
              more frequently in women with kidney disease than in the general
              population, so needs to be prescribed with care..
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Barrier methods of contraception are effective, so long as they
              are used carefully. The male <strong>condom</strong> and female
              condom (<strong>Femidom</strong>) also act as a barrier to the
              spread of sexually transmitted diseases, for example herpes or
              AIDS. A <strong>diaphragm</strong> or
              <strong> spermicidal jelly</strong> can also be used.
              Disadvantages of these methods are that men may not like to use a
              condom. Women may find it difficult to position the
              <strong>Femidom </strong> or a
              <strong>diaphragm</strong> correctly into the vagina; or find the
              process distasteful, especially since spermicidal jelly must be
              used as well, to increase the effectiveness of the contraceptive.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Failure of a barrier method may occur when the device becomes
              dislodged during or after intercourse. Kidney patients are able to
              take the <strong>‘morning after pill’</strong>, but this treatment
              can cause sickness and should not be used regularly.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              The <strong>oral contraceptive pill</strong> (often just called
              <strong> ‘The Pill’s</strong>) can be used in women with kidney
              diseases, but a low oestrogen type is generally preferred. High
              blood pressure is very common in women with kidney diseases, and
              this is also a common side effect of oral contraceptives.
              Therefore blood pressure should be monitored and sometimes it is
              necessary to increase the dose of blood pressure drugs.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Women can use an <strong>intrauterine coil.</strong> This is a
              small plastic and metal device which is inserted into the neck of
              the womb. Someone experienced is needed to insert and remove a
              coil, usually a doctor or nurse. Contraception is generally
              effective, though the coil may cause some bleeding or heavier
              periods, and there is a small risk of infection in the womb. There
              is a new type of coil available, which may suit some people, and
              may overcome some of the disadvantages of coils. It is marketed in
              the UK under the name <strong>‘Mirena’</strong>, and combines some
              hormonal treatment with the coil effect. Unlike the old copper
              coil, Mirena reduces menstrual bleeding and in many cases periods
              stop completely. In some women on dialysis, this may be an
              advantage if the blood loss from periods has caused anaemia.
              <strong>Mirena</strong> is less likely to raise blood pressure
              than some oral contraceptive methods, but like any type of
              medication can have side effects. It needs to be inserted by a
              doctor and changed every five years..

              A man can have a <strong>vasectomy</strong> or a woman can be
              <strong>sterilised</strong>. These procedures can be carried out
              in people with kidney failure in the same way as anyone else.
              Before contemplating sterilisation, it is important to realise
              that the success of reversal by surgery is limited, so if someone
              changes his or her mind about children, it may not be possible to
              regain normal fertility. Lastly, sterilisation does not protect
              against sexually transmitted diseases, so safe sex with barrier
              methods should be practised if having sex with multiple partners.

              Although male fertility may remain normal with kidney disease,
              loss of sex drive and impotence (not being able to raise an
              erection) are very common. There are a number of causes for this,
              including anaemia and testosterone deficiency. These can be tested
              for, and in many cases treated.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Men with kidney failure have a variety of sexual problems. These
              include having sex less often, loss of interest in sex (sometimes
              called loss of libido), and being unable to ejaculate (come).
              However, the most common sexual problem – and usually the most
              worrying for the man – is difficulty in getting or keeping a hard
              penis (erection problems). This is usually called impotence.
              Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an alternative name.

            <p class="overview-text">
              What normally happens first in men with kidney failure is that
              they become less able to keep an erection for as long as usual,
              although they are still able to ejaculate. Eventually, many kidney
              patients lose the ability to get a hard penis at all. This can
              obviously lead to frustration, particularly if the sex drive is
              unchanged. The situation can be even more upsetting if the man’s
              partner interprets the problem as a loss of interest in them

            <ul class="kidney-list-box-list">
              <span>
                Impotence has many possible causes. In most men with kidney
                failure, sexual problems do not have just one cause, but are
                usually due to a combination of:</span
              >

              <li>
                Poor blood supply. In order to make the penis hard, extra blood
                enters the penis and is then prevented from leaving it. Many
                kidney patients have narrowed blood vessels all over their body,
                including those vessels that supply the penis. This reduces the
                blood supply to the penis, and makes it difficult to get an
                erection. It is not just kidney patients who have this problem.
                It also occurs as part of the natural ageing process and is
                commoner in older men, as well as in men with diabetes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Leaky blood vessels. To keep the penis hard, the extra blood
                that has entered the penis must stay inside it. In men with
                kidney failure, the extra blood sometimes leaks back out of the
                penis, and so the erection is lost.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hormonal disturbances. Hormones are chemical messengers that
                control many body functions. They are carried around the body in
                the blood. Some hormones are specifically designed to control
                sexual urges. The levels of these sex hormones can be either
                higher or lower than normal in people with kidney failure. In
                particular, the testicles may produce less of the male sex
                hormone, testosterone
              </li>
              <li>
                Nerve damage. The nerves that supply the penis are also involved
                in getting an erection. When someone has kidney failure, nerve
                damage may prevent the nerves from working properly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tablets. Most tablets do not cause impotence on their own.
                However, a few drugs can contribute to sexual problems. The
                biggest culprits are the blood pressure tablets called beta
                blockers, such as atenolol, propanolol, metoprolol and
                bisoprolol.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tiredness. Tiredness can affect sexual performance. Tiredness in
                kidney patient may be caused by anaemia, by not receiving enough
                dialysis, or by other medical problems, such as heart disease.
              </li>
              <li>
                Psychological problems. When a kidney patient starts dialysis
                there are many stresses to deal with. Not surprisingly, some
                patients feel quite depressed. If so, they may not feel like
                having sex.
              </li>
              <li>
                Relationship difficulties. The illness of one partner naturally
                causes stresses in a relationship. For instance, household jobs,
                such a decorating or washing-up, which used to be done by the
                patient may now sometimes have to be done by the partner. This
                can lead to arguments or resentment on either side of the
                relationship.

              There is often a lot of unnecessary suffering due to either denial
              of the problem or fear of embarrassment. Some kidney doctors and
              nurses have no experience of treating sexual problems in people
              with kidney failure, or are embarrassed themselves. If this is the
              case, patients should ask to see an expert in sexual problems.

              <li>
                A general health check. This will include an assessment of the
                distance a person can walk on level ground without having to
                stop, which is a useful guide to general health.
              </li>
              <li>
                Physical examination. This will include an examination of the
                genitals. The doctor will also feel for a pulse at various
                points in the legs. If the pulses are weak, this means that the
                blood vessels in the legs have narrowed, reducing the blood
                supply. Then there will usually also be narrowing of the blood
                vessels supplying the penis, reducing its blood supply.
              </li>
              <li>
                Blood tests. In addition to the usual blood tests, there will be
                tests to measure the blood levels of various hormones. These
                include testosterone, and also luteinising hormone (LH),
                follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and prolactin. LH and FSH are
                hormones that regulate the testicles. Prolactin’s usual role is
                to produce milk in females, but it is often present in larger
                than normal amounts in male dialysis patients with impotence.
              </li>
              <li>
                Review of medication. The doctor should review the various
                tablets that the patient is taking. Some types of tablets may
                contribute to a patient's sexual difficulties. Alternative
                medication is sometimes available.
              </li>
              <li>
                Investigation of psycho-sexual problems. The patient will be
                asked to consider whether psychological or relationship

            <p class="overview-text">
              Most male dialysis patients with sexual problems have low
              testosterone levels. This deficiency can be treated by an
              injection of testosterone every three to four weeks. Although
              testosterone injections replace the hormone that is lacking, they
              are not always very effective in treating impotence. This is
              probably because impotence in men with kidney failure is not
              usually due only to low testosterone levels.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Many other hormones are also often found to be at the wrong level,
              but correcting them rarely makes much difference to sexual
              difficulties. If the prolactin level is too high, a tablet called
              bromocriptine (or sometimes one of the newer alternative drugs,
              such as cabergoline) may be given.

            <p class="overview-text">
              Viagra is a tablet treatment for impotence, which has been widely
              reported in the media since its US launch in April 1998. Viagra
              acts by enhancing the action of a compound called nitric oxide,
              which opens wide the blood vessels of the penis, leading to an
              erection. Other drugs with a similar mechanism of action, called
              vardenafil and tadalfil, are undergoing trials.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Research with Viagra in men on dialysis has shown that about 3 in
              4 men who used the drug found they developed erections. The
              success rate may be a little lower in men who have diabetes as
              well as kidney failure. Side effects such as headaches and low
              blood pressure occurred in 1 in 4 men, with some having to stop
              using the drug. Men who are taking nitrate drugs (isisorbide
              mononitrate or isisorbide dinitrate) should not take Viagra within
              a week of using the nitrate, and nitrates that are used under the
              tongue or as a spray should not be used for 24 hours before or
              after Viagra. Nitrates plus Viagra can cause a dangerous fall in
              blood pressure.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Anyone with heart disease should have a careful assessment to see
              if Viagra is safe in his or her case, as the low blood pressure
              that Viagra can cause could be dangerous in the presence of
              serious heart disease.

            <p class="overview-text">
              Viagra can be prescribed to people with kidney failure on the
              National Health Service and many doctors interpret this as
              including men with advanced kidney failure not yet receiving
              dialysis.

            <h2 id="vacu" class="overview-header">Vacuum devices</h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Many kidney patients with impotence require therapies which act
              directly on the penis, helping them to get and keep an erection.
              One of these is called vacuum tumescence therapy, which uses a
              mechanical device (such as the ErecAid) to produce a hard penis.
              Nearly three quarters of the male dialysis patients who use a
              vacuum device are able to have full penile erections.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              To use the vacuum device, the man first inserts his penis into the
              clear plastic cylinder. He then holds the device against his body
              so that the chamber is closed with an air-tight seal. Using either
              a hand or battery operated pump, the man then withdraws air from
              the cylinder to form a vacuum. This causes the penis to enlarge in
              a way that is similar to a natural erection. However, to maintain
              the erection, the man must then push a tension ring (resembling an
              elastic band) from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of
              the penis. The seal of the vacuum is broken, and the cylinder and
              pump are removed. With the tension ring in place, the erection can
              be maintained for up to 30 minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              The erections may be longer lasting than natural ones, and do not
              usually disappear after an orgasm. The most common complaints are
              mild discomfort and ‘timing difficulties’ (such as pumping too
              rapidly with the hand pump) when the device is first used.
              Occasionally, harmless, tiny reddish spots (called petechiae) may
              appear on the penis
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              The main advantages of vacuum therapy are that it is safe and does
              not require an operation, can be used as often as desired, and
              works well for most male dialysis patients. Its suppliers also
              claim that it may improve blood flow to the penis and result in
              occasional natural erections.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              The disadvantages of vacuum therapy are that it involves a loss of
              spontaneity in lovemaking, it requires some skill to use, and it
              can cause mild bruising. It is also not available on the NHS. The
              current cost is over GBP £200, but only the initial outlay is
              usually required.

            <p class="overview-text">
              Penile injection therapy is another non surgical technique used to
              treat impotence. The man injects medication (usually alprostadil)
              into the base of his penis. This causes the penis to become hard
              almost immediately. The erection then lasts for up to one to two
              hours. Use of the injections is limited to not more than once a
              day and three times a week. Several clinic visits are usually
              needed to establish the dose of medication required. Treatment is
              available on the NHS.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Penile injections have the advantage of not involving surgery.
              They are also effective in many dialysis patients. It is not
              known, however, whether the success rate for these injections in
              kidney patients is as high as 70%.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              The main problems with this technique are pain in the penis, and a
              condition called priapism, which is an unwanted erection that goes
              on too long. There may also be bleeding, bruising or scarring
              (fibrosis) at the injection site. Because of the risk of bleeding,
              patients on haemodialysis are advised not to have the injection on
              a dialysis day. Another problem is that the penis may become
              misshapen. After a while, some patients get fed up with this
              treatment, but it is usually possible for them to change to a
              different therapy option.

              insertion therapy, such as MUSE (Medicated Urethral System for
              Erection), the patient slowly inserts an applicator into the end
              of his penis. A button on the applicator is then pressed to
              release a tiny pellet of medication (alprostadil). Once the pellet

              Penile insertion therapy has been shown to be successful in just

              The decision to have a penile implant should be made only after
              very careful consideration. This surgical treatment for impotence
              is usually effective, but it does have disadvantages (see below).
              The implant is inserted during an operation performed under a
              general anaesthetic. There are various different types available.
              Typically, a cylinder implanted in the penis is connected by a
              tube to a pump in the scrotum. This pump is connected by another
              tube to a fluid containing reservoir in the abdomen. Squeezing the
              pump with the fingers causes fluid to pass from the reservoir into
              the cylinder, so simulating an erection. The main disadvantage is
              that the operation to insert the implant alters the penis
              permanently, ending all hope of natural erections. There is also a
              risk of infection, and a possibility that the implant will be
              rejected by the immune system (the body’s defence system). Another
              problem is that an implant can be difficult to conceal.

              It is common for the menstrual periods to become irregular when

              than 20% of normal (blood creatinine level roughly over 250
              micromoles per litre in a young woman), she will probably be less
              likely to become pregnant than normal, even if she is having
              regular sex. However, contraception should still be used, as

            <p class="overview-text">
              In dialysis patients, periods often stop completely or are

              become pregnant. However, again, women should not rely on this as
              a form of contraception. It is still possible to get pregnant even
              if the periods are absent.

              Treatment with erythropoeitin (EPO) has been shown to restore

              neglected, those of female patients are almost completely ignored.
              As yet, there has been very little research carried out into the
              sexual difficulties of female dialysis patients. The largest study
              was a survey of 99 Italian female haemodialysis patients. Compared
              to women who did not have kidney failure, the dialysis patients
              had sex less often and were less able to have an orgasm. Also,
              most patients noticed a loss of sex drive. If a young woman is not
              having periods, research has shown that, with hormone replacement
              therapy, sex drive is often improved. This is in addition to the
              other benefits of hormone replacement therapy. Some women with
              kidney failure are deficient in testosterone. Although this is
              normally thought of as a male hormone, it is required, in small
              amounts, to play a part in female libido (sex drive). Sex life
              frequently returns to normal after a successful kidney transplant.

            <p class="overview-text">
              Inhibited desire, not wanting sex, may be due to many factors.
              Women may still want to be intimate with their partners but not
              want penetration. If the physical problems associated with kidney
              failure (such as anaemia and hormonal problems) have been dealt
              with, then sex therapy may be an effective treatment, encouraging
              the couple to talk through problems and learn new techniques in
              lovemaking.

            <h2 id="laab" class="overview-header">Lack of ability to orgasm</h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Many women can have pleasurable sex without orgasm, but lack of
              orgasm is a problem for many women. It is a myth that female
              orgasm is associated with penile penetration and thrusting. Most
              women need clitoral stimulation. Anaemia and hormonal disturbance
              can affect the ability to have an orgasm, and these should be
              treated. However, some women may require additional clitoral
              stimulation. This can be achieved using manual stimulation or a
              vibrator. If these do not work, a vacuum device called Eros
              (www.eros-therapy.com), which stimulates clitoral blood flow, may
              suit some women, though it is advised that it is used after advice
              from a doctor or psychosexual therapist. Trials are under way to
              investigate the value of creams containing a drug called
              alprostadil, which may increase genital and clitoral blood flow.
              This drug is also used to give impotent men erections.

              Pain on intercourse (also called dyspareunia)
            </h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Pain during penetration is a common problem for women. It may be
              due to a lack of lubrication, or an infection such as thrush. An
              allergy to condoms or contraceptive creams may also be
              responsible. A doctor or therapist may need to be consulted. If a
              women gets into a cycle where sex is always associated with pain,
              it may be damaging for the woman and her relationship with a
              partner.

            <h2 id="vagi" class="overview-header">Vaginismus</h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              This is an involuntary spasm, or tightening, of the muscles around
              the vagina, which may make penetration painful or impossible. Many
              different factors can cause vaginismus, such as painful
              intercourse, anxiety and previous traumatic experiences such as
              sexual abuse or complicated childbirth. It is important to
              recognise that vaginismus may occur in women who are otherwise
              sexually responsive and affectionate with their partner. A doctor
              or sex therapist should be able to help someone with vaginismus.
