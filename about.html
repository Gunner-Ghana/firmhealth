            We are committed to being the lifeline to the end line of persons
            diagnosed with kidney disease. To this end, we have since 2013,
            initiated a weekly public-health education program on a local FM
            radio station known as Dynamite FM (88.9). The radio program reaches
            over 70,000 people in about 30 communities every week. The
            foundation strengthens the radio program by visiting communities to
            undertake free screening sessions. We have visited 29 communities
            and screened over 12,000 people. The Foundation reinforces its
            advocacy efforts through community forums and durbars to educate
            traditional authorities and local healthcare givers. We also
            organize bi-weekly diabetes and hypertension clinics to enlighten
            afflicted persons on management strategies of renal disease.
