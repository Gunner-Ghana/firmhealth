            <p class="overview-text">
              Kidney disease describes a variety of conditions and disorders
              that affect the kidneys. Most kidney disease attack the filtering
              units of the kidneys—the nephrons—and damage their ability to
              eliminate wastes and excess fluids. Kidney disease can range from
              mild to severe and in some cases, lead to kidney failure
              (sometimes referred to as end-stage kidney disease).

            <h2 class="overview-header">What is acute kidney injury (AKI)?</h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Acute kidney injury (AKI), also known as acute renal failure
              (ARF), is a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that
              happens within a few hours or a few days. AKI causes a build-up of
              waste products in your blood and makes it hard for your kidneys to
              keep the right balance of fluid in your body. AKI can also affect
              other organs such as the brain, heart, and lungs. Acute kidney
              injury is common in patients who are in the hospital, in intensive
              care units, and especially in older adults.
