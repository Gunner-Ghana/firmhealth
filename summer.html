            <p class="overview-text">
              The Health and Research Summer Internship Program (HRSIP) is
              designed for students interested in healthcare, nursing,
              dentistry, mental health, nephrology, optometry, medicine and
              public health. It offers students the opportunity to work at local
              hospitals and underserved communities under the direction of
              licensed local health professionals.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              The program is based in Tarkwa in the Western region of Ghana, a
              dynamic metropolitan area of over two hundred thousand people, and
              the heartland of the largest mining enclave in the entire West
              Africa. Students will be exposed to a unique healthcare system
              that challenges them to rethink novice ways of addressing
              healthcare challenges in a third world country.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Medical and Nursing students will learn about how primary care
              physicians and nurses’ function under limited resources while
              being exposed to rare infectious diseases and treatment modalities
              using local resources. Students will shadow licensed healthcare
              professionals at the Apinto Government Hospital, Tarkwa Municipal
              Hospital and Accra Medical Center through clinical rotations to
              help them understand the vital role of sociocultural competence in
              healthcare delivery. Dental students are assigned to a mobile unit
              to visit elementary, junior and senior high schools to educate
              students and screen them for possible cavities or diseases.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Public health students assist medical professionals in undertaking
              screening services in underserved communities. Students have once
              in a lifetime opportunity to join weekly public health radio
              discussions on Dynamite FM (88.9) to share their experiences as
              well as educate the populace on selected weekly topics.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              There are multiple ongoing research projects for students to apply
              their quantitative and analytical skills. Each student must commit
              to actively engage in research projects that could lead to journal
              publications. We are currently trying to understand the prevalence
              of HIV, Sexual Abuse, Anemia among pregnant women and malaria
              cases in each of the health facilities we work in. Students are
              encouraged to explore other avenues for potential research and
              discuss with their preceptors.

            <h2 id="abgha" class="overview-header">About Ghana</h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Ghana is known as the gateway to Africa. Homes are small and
              stuffy, so people are always out and about. Ghana is an exciting
              and popular place to spend some time on a volunteer project or
              internship. Ghana is an intensely colorful land on the West coast
              of Africa. Once the British colony known as the 'Gold Coast', it
              is renowned for the friendliness and warmth of its people. Ghana
              has great beaches, wild savannahs, and dense rainforests. This
              English-speaking country provides volunteers with a wonderful
              introduction to Africa; it is politically-stable, safe,
              affordable, and rewarding to visit. You can explore historic slave
              forts, shop in bustling colorful markets, wander through
              rainforests, or laze on the hundreds of miles of beaches. When you
              explore this magnificent African country, you’ll discover lakes
              and wetlands, fascinating historical sites and a profound
              heritage. Gorgeous beaches offer a paradise on earth, and you will
              find yourself expanding and relaxing into the warmth of the
              African sun, the sweeping blue skies over the mountains and green
              forest. Most importantly you will love the people you serve and
              gain an experience the classroom can never offer. Ghana has made
              lot of strides in the healthcare sector but also faced with unique
              challenges. The internship provides unique opportunity to learn
              and experience the Ghanaian culture, arts, and healthcare system.
              Students are encouraged to bring resources that can assist and
              improve their experience.

            <p class="overview-text">
              Interns are accommodated in student hostels where they will live
              with other interns and local staff. While volunteering in Ghana,
              most volunteers will stay in our Home-based. This concept is a
              permanent residence set up especially for international
              volunteers. There are several bedrooms at our Home-based and
              volunteers will normally share a room with a same gender
              volunteer. There are common rooms fully equipped with a television
              and Wi-Fi. We manage interns’ meal plans and accommodations for
              the duration of your time in Ghana. Three meals a day (breakfast,
              lunch and dinner) will be provided and will consist of local
              ingredients and feature traditional cuisine choices for Ghana. Our
              meal program can accommodate vegetarian needs; however, we are not
              able to provide for other dietary restrictions. Food and drinks
              outside of mealtimes are the interns’ responsibility. In most
              cases, there are restaurants and markets nearby the homes in which
              our volunteers stay. The environment is very relaxed and social
              and a great place to unwind after a busy day. The kitchen and
              bathrooms are shared, and there is running water and
              “western-style” toilets. The neighborhood is very safe and clean.
              There are many amenities nearby like internet cafés, grocery
              stores, restaurants and mass transit stop. We put safety and
              comfort first as we deliver enriching and consistent experiences
              for our students. Our support is multi-faceted while in-country
              and our staff is in contact with our interns on a regular basis
              either with face-to-face visits or via phone/email. Key support
              comes from our country coordinator and in-country field staff.
              These individuals are part of the Firm Health Ghana Foundation
              setup and its partners. They are committed to ensuring your
              experience the best it can be. Interns also have access to our
              country coordinator’s mobile number for emergencies. With longer
              assignments, our field staff visits regularly (every 2-4 weeks) to
              ensure the experience is meeting your expectations. Sometimes an
              assignment may be too far to visit physically, so staff members
              will touch-base via phone/email. You are also welcome to stop in
              the offices at any time. You are never alone. Living is basic but
              the large majority of the volunteer houses have electricity and
              running water. If you have special eating needs, please let us
              know ahead of time so that we can make arrangements for you.
              However, we need to stress the point that you should not expect to
              eat as you normally do at home. We will do our best to see that
              you are well taken care of, but also as an intern, there is a need
              to be flexible. Specific details regarding accommodations, food
              and contact details for our local coordinator will be provided in
              personalized intern placement documentation prior to arrival.
