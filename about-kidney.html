              Kidney disease describes a variety of conditions and disorders
              that affect the kidneys. Most kidney disease attack the filtering
              units of the kidneys—the nephrons—and damage their ability to
              eliminate wastes and excess fluids. Kidney disease can range from
              mild to severe and in some cases, lead to kidney failure

            <p class="overview-text">
              Acute kidney injury (AKI), also known as acute renal failure
              (ARF), is a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that
              happens within a few hours or a few days. AKI causes a build-up of
              waste products in your blood and makes it hard for your kidneys to
              keep the right balance of fluid in your body. AKI can also affect
              other organs such as the brain, heart, and lungs. Acute kidney
              injury is common in patients who are in the hospital, in intensive
              care units, and especially in older adults.

              <li>

              What is the treatment for acute kidney injury?
            </h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Treatment for AKI usually requires you to stay in a hospital. Most
              people with acute kidney injury are already in the hospital for
              another reason. How long you will stay in the hospital depends on
              the cause of your AKI and how quickly your kidneys recover. In
              more serious cases, dialysis may be needed to help replace kidney
              function until your kidneys recover. The main goal of your
              healthcare provider is to treat what is causing your acute kidney
              injury. Your healthcare provider will work to treat all of your
              symptoms and complications until your kidneys recover.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              After having AKI, your chances are higher for other health
              problems (such as kidney disease, stroke, heart disease) or having
              AKI again in the future. The chances for developing kidney disease
              and kidney failure increase every time AKI occurs. To protect
              yourself, you should follow up with your healthcare provider to
              keep track of your kidney function and recovery. The best ways to
              lower your chances of having kidney damage and to save kidney
              function are to prevent acute kidney injury or to find and treat
              it as early as possible.

            <p class="overview-text">
              Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means your kidneys are damaged and
              can’t filter blood the way they should. The disease is called
              “chronic” because the damage to your kidneys happens slowly over a
              long period of time. This damage can cause wastes to build up in
              your body. CKD can also cause other health problems.

            <p class="overview-text">
              The kidneys’ main job is to filter extra water and wastes out of
              your blood to make urine. To keep your body working properly, the
              kidneys balance the salts and minerals—such as calcium,
              phosphorus, sodium, and potassium—that circulate in the blood.
              Your kidneys also make hormones that help control blood pressure,
              make red blood cells, and keep your bones strong.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              Kidney disease often can get worse over time and may lead to
              kidney failure. If your kidneys fail, you will need dialysis or a
              kidney transplant to maintain your health. The sooner you know you
              have kidney disease, the sooner you can make changes to protect
              your kidneys.

              healthy. You can also have kidney damage without any symptoms
              because, despite the damage, your kidneys are still doing enough
              work to keep you feeling well. For many people, the only way to

              The kidneys act like sieves, filtering the waste and excess fluid
              from the blood. Blood passes through the kidneys and is cleaned
              before returning to the heart.

                called nephrons sieve the blood.
              </li>
              <li>
                Certain substances the body needs are reabsorbed and the waste

              <li>
                The clean blood returns to the body through the renal veins.
              </li>
              <li>
                The urine is carried from the kidneys to the bladder by tubes

              </li>
              <li>
                The bladder stores the urine until it is full, when the urine

              Each day, the kidneys process about 190 litres (335 pints) of
              blood through 145 miles (225km) of ‘tubes’ and millions of mini
              filtering systems called ‘nephrons’.in addition to filtering the
              blood and balancing fluid levels in the body, the kidneys also
              produce different hormones and chemicals, which perform several
              key functions.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              <strong>Erythropoietin</strong> is a hormone which travels in the
              bloodstream from the kidneys to the bone marrow where it prompts
              the bone marrow to make red blood cells. Red blood cells carry the
              oxygen the body needs to function properly. Without healthy red
              blood cells, people develop anaemia, which can cause them to feel
              weak, cold, tired and short of breath.

            <p class="overview-text">
              <strong> Control of blood pressure –</strong> when kidneys are
              diseased, blood pressure increases. High blood pressure is
              important - it can increase the risk of stroke, heart disease and
              further damage the kidneys.
            </p>

              <strong>The kidneys maintain the correct balance</strong> between
              calcium and phosphate in the blood and the bones, and produce

              <strong>Monitor your blood pressure -</strong> High blood pressure
              accelerates kidney damage. To protect yourself from kidney disease
              you should also maintain a diet low in salt and saturated fats.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              <strong>Keep fit and active -</strong> This helps reduce your
              blood pressure and therefore reduces the risk of kidney disease.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              <strong>Don’t smoke -</strong> Smoking slows blood flow to the

            <p class="overview-text">
              <strong>Eat healthily and keep your weight in check -</strong>
              This can help prevent diabetes, heart disease and other conditions

            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              <strong>Get your kidney function checked - </strong> If anyone in
              your family has suffered from kidney disease, you are diabetic or
              have high blood pressure or if you are of South Asian or
              African-Caribbean ethnic background.

                toxins and impurities in the blood. This can cause people to
                feel tired, weak and can make it hard to concentrate. Another
                complication of kidney disease is anemia, which can cause
                weakness and fatigue.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>You're having trouble sleeping.</strong> When the
                kidneys aren't filtering properly, toxins stay in the blood
                rather than leaving the body through the urine. This can make it
                difficult to sleep. There is also a link between obesity and
                chronic kidney disease, and sleep apnea is more common in those
                with chronic kidney disease, compared with the general
                population.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>You have dry and itchy skin.</strong> Healthy kidneys do
                many important jobs. They remove wastes and extra fluid from
                your body, help make red blood cells, help keep bones strong and
                work to maintain the right amount of minerals in your blood. Dry
                and itchy skin can be a sign of the mineral and bone disease
                that often accompanies advanced kidney disease, when the kidneys
                are no longer able to keep the right balance of minerals and
                nutrients in your blood.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>You feel the need to urinate more often.</strong> If you
                feel the need to urinate more often, especially at night, this
                can be a sign of kidney disease. When the kidneys filters are
                damaged, it can cause an increase in the urge to urinate.
                Sometimes this can also be a sign of a urinary infection or
                enlarged prostate in men.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>You see blood in your urine.</strong> Healthy kidneys
                typically keep the blood cells in the body when filtering wastes
                from the blood to create urine, but when the kidney's filters
                have been damaged, these blood cells can start to "leak" out
                into the urine. In addition to signaling kidney disease, blood
                in the urine can be indicative of tumors, kidney stones or an
                infection.
              </li>

                <strong>Your urine is foamy.</strong> Excessive bubbles in the
                urine – especially those that require you to flush several times
                before they go away—indicate protein in the urine. This foam may
                look like the foam you see when scrambling eggs, as the common
                protein found in urine, albumin, is the same protein that is
                found in eggs.

                  eyes.</strong
                >
                Protein in the urine is an early sign that the kidneys’ filters
                have been damaged, allowing protein to leak into the urine. This
                puffiness around your eyes can be due to the fact that your
                kidneys are leaking a large amount of protein in the urine,
                rather than keeping it in the body.

                <strong>Your ankles and feet are swollen.</strong> Decreased
                kidney function can lead to sodium retention, causing swelling
                in your feet and ankles. Swelling in the lower extremities can
                also be a sign of heart disease, liver disease and chronic leg
                vein problems.

              A blood test is used to measure your serum creatinine level which
              helps to indicate how well the kidneys are filtering the blood.
              Creatinine is a waste product made from muscle use and the
              breakdown of the protein you eat. As the blood creatinine rises,
              kidney function decreases. Decreased kidney function means that
              your kidneys are not able to remove the toxins and waste products
              from your blood as well as someone with normal kidney function.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
              The estimate (or percentage) of kidney function is called the
              glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or estimated glomerular
              filtration rate (eGFR). Glomeruli are tiny blood vessels in the
              kidney that help to filter waste. The GFR is a way of measuring
              how well the kidneys are working by determining the rate at which
              the glomeruli are filtering waste products from your blood. The
              eGFR is the most common way to measure kidney function at kidney
              clinics.

            <p class="overview-text">
              Simple laboratory tests such as urinalysis (a urine dipstick),
              which looks for blood and a protein called albumin in the urine,
              are also useful in detecting kidney damage at an early stage and
              determining your risk of losing more kidney function. The filters
              of the kidney do not normally allow protein in the urine so if
              protein (albumin) is detected, it is a sign that the filters of
              the kidney are being damaged. The more albumin that you have in
              your urine, the greater the risk of losing kidney function over
              time. Other blood tests, X-rays, kidney ultrasound or a kidney
              biopsy may also be needed to diagnose the specific type of kidney
              disease and to determine the appropriate treatment.

                If your kidney function continues to decline, you may start
                developing symptoms of kidney disease. Each person is different,
                but most people will start to develop uremia as the kidneys fail
                and are unable to remove wastes from the body. There are many
                symptoms of uremia that occur as kidney function declines,
